# Customer Performance Insights

## Executive Summary -

Customer analysis reveals clear revenue stratification across the customer base. While the overall rental activity is broadly distributed, a smaller group of customers contributes a disproportionately higher share of total revenue.

This indicates strong lifetime value concentration and highlights the importance of customer retention strategies.

## Customer Revenue Distribution -

Customer spending patterns demonstrate measurable variation in lifetime value.

Key observations:

* A segment of customers consistently generates higher cumulative revenue.
* The majority of customers fall into a mid-to-low revenue contribution range.
* Revenue contribution follows a concentration pattern typical of transactional businesses.

Business interpretation:

The business is moderately dependent on high-value customers, making retention programs strategically important.

## Customer Segmentation Analysis -

Based on revenue-based segmentation:

* High-value customers show strong repeat rental behavior.
* Medium-value customers represent growth opportunity.
* Low-value customers contribute volume but limited revenue impact.

Strategic implication:

Moving medium-tier customers into higher engagement categories can significantly increase total revenue without major acquisition costs.

## Purchase Frequency Behavior -

Rental frequency analysis shows:

* Certain customers rent consistently over time.
* Higher rental frequency correlates directly with higher lifetime value.
* Repeat behavior is a primary driver of revenue growth.

Business insight:

Revenue growth depends more on retention and engagement than on pricing adjustments.

## Recency Patterns -

Recent activity analysis highlights:

* Active customers maintain steady rental behavior.
* Dormant customers represent reactivation opportunities.
* Time-based inactivity can signal churn risk.

Strategic recommendation:

Implement targeted re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers to reduce churn probability.

## Strategic Recommendations -

1. Introduce loyalty tiers for high-value customers.
2. Design promotional campaigns for mid-tier customers to increase rental frequency.
3. Implement churn detection logic using recency indicators.
4. Focus on retention-driven growth rather than aggressive price-based strategies.
5. Use behavioral segmentation to personalize marketing outreach.
